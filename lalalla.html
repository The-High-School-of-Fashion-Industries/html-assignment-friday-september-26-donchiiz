    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p1>My name is Daniela Castillo, I'm a current high school student in my junior year at the high school of fashion industries, uniquely enrolled in the software development program. Where the main focus (as of currently) is web development. </p1>
    <h2>Hobbies </h2>
    <p1> I like to do many things and occasionally try something new every now and then. Usually I spend time playing videogames, watching anime, sketching outfits, roller blading, and am currently in a skate boarding program. I also like to read but usually stick it to online, (like mangas) but I'd appreciate a good occasional physical chapter book.</p1>
